    It's been a month with you, baby, and honestly, I write this message to you with tears of joy in my eyes. My life has taken a very visible turn since you came into my life, since you said the words that made my year: ‘I would be your girlfriend.’ From that moment, my heart has known a peace and happiness it never felt before. Every day with you feels like a beautiful part of a love story I never want to end. You’ve touched my soul in ways words can’t fully express, and I find myself falling deeper for you with every smile, every laugh, and every moment we share. One month may seem like a short period of time, but to me, it’s the start of something endless, something that feels like forever.
    Sometimes I fear how deeply I fell for you because it makes me realize how much you mean to me, how much I never want to lose this. But that’s also what makes this love so real, so genuine. I love you more than I can put into words, baby, and I’m so thankful I get to call you mine.
    No matter where life takes us, one thing will never change — I’ll keep choosing you, over and over again.

    Honestly, these past months have been extremely amazing, literally the best year of my life already. You’ve made me the happiest person alive. I know we’ve had one or two down moments, but the beautiful ones outweigh them. A little recap to the first time we met physically — 10th May 2025. That very day, I felt it in my heart that you were the one. You’re such an amazing soul.
    It wasn’t an easy task getting you to say yes, but I can proudly say you were and are very worth the difficulty. Like they say, good things don’t come easy. I always say “Michelle is my blessing from God.” You may think I’m exaggerating, but I’m not.
    I love you beyond measure, beyond human comprehension, and honestly, you’re the best girlfriend in the world. I love you sooooo veryyyy muchhhh, baby.

    There are so many things I could say to you, but even the most beautiful words sometimes feel too small to hold the way I feel. I'm endlessly grateful to have you in my life. You're more than just my girlfriend — you're my safe place, my peace, and my spark. I wouldn't trade you for anything in this world.
    Every moment we've shared means everything to me. The laughter, the deep talks, the quiet glances, especially those times I look into your eyes and get completely lost, like no map could ever find me. You bring out the child in me, the carefree, joyful side I thought I had buried. You've reminded me how it feels to truly live in a moment.
